## Implementation Strategy for Stretch Goals

Once POC is stable (v1.0.0+):
1. Choose one feature from Priority Stretch Goals
2. Discuss requirements with user
3. Create detailed implementation plan (like CLAUDE.md format)
4. Implement incrementally with testing
5. Release as minor version (e.g., v1.1.0)
6. Repeat

---

## Notes

- Stretch goals should not compromise core app stability
- Each feature should be thoroughly tested before next
- Consider user feedback when prioritizing
- Some features (like bank sync) have ongoing costs to consider
- Multi-user features require security audit
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
