# MoneyWise - Implementation Plan

**Version:** POC (Proof of Concept) → v1.0.0  
**Environment:** Python with `uv` virtual environment (already created and activated)  
**Tech Stack:** FastAPI + SQLite + Vue.js + Chart.js  
**Development Approach:** Frontend-first, incremental testing after each feature

---

## Project Overview

MoneyWise is a personal budget and expense tracking application based on envelope budgeting principles, inspired by Aspire Budgeting. This is a desktop-first, locally-hosted web application for single-user financial management.

### Core Principles
- **Manual entry only** - No automatic bank sync (intentional for financial awareness)
- **Single database** - One SQLite database for all years of data
- **Frontend-first development** - Build UI first with placeholders, then connect to backend
- **Incremental testing** - User tests each feature with real data before proceeding to next phase
- **Simple & focused** - Clean scope, no feature creep in POC
- **Currency agnostic** - Display amounts in any currency with live exchange rates

---

```

---

## Database Schema

Design a SQLite database with the following tables using SQLAlchemy ORM:

### **accounts** table
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `name` - String, unique, not null (e.g., "Checking", "Wells Fargo Card")
- `account_type` - String, not null, either "bank" or "credit"
- `is_hidden` - Boolean, default False (for hiding old accounts)
- `created_at` - DateTime
- `updated_at` - DateTime

### **categories** table
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `name` - String, unique, not null (e.g., "Groceries", "Dining Out")
- `is_hidden` - Boolean, default False (for hiding old categories)
- `created_at` - DateTime
- `updated_at` - DateTime

### **category_renames** table
Track history when categories are renamed:
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `category_id` - Foreign key to categories
- `old_name` - String, not null
- `renamed_at` - DateTime, not null

### **transactions** table
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `date` - Date, not null
- `amount` - Decimal(12, 2), not null (positive = inflow, negative = outflow)
- `account_id` - Foreign key to accounts, not null
- `category_id` - Foreign key to categories, nullable (null for transfers)
- `memo` - String, nullable (description/note)
- `is_transfer` - Boolean, default False (true for account transfers)
- `transfer_id` - String, nullable (UUID linking paired transfer transactions)
- `created_at` - DateTime
- `updated_at` - DateTime

### **category_transfers** table
Moving money between budget categories:
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `date` - Date, not null
- `amount` - Decimal(12, 2), not null (always positive)
- `from_category_id` - Foreign key to categories, nullable (null if from "Available to budget")
- `to_category_id` - Foreign key to categories, not null
- `memo` - String, nullable
- `created_at` - DateTime

### **reconciliations** table
Track when accounts were reconciled:
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `account_id` - Foreign key to accounts, not null
- `reconciled_date` - Date, not null
- `created_at` - DateTime

### **exchange_rates** table
Cache currency exchange rates:
- `id` - Integer primary key
- `base_currency` - String(3), not null (e.g., "USD")
- `target_currency` - String(3), not null (e.g., "EUR")
- `rate` - Decimal(12, 6), not null
- `fetched_at` - DateTime, not null

**Important indexes to create:**
- Index on `transactions.date` for date range queries

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: Project Foundation (v0.1.0-alpha)
**Goal:** Create a launchable application shell that user can immediately open in browser.

#### What to Build:
1. **Project structure**: Create all directories and empty `__init__.py` files where needed
2. **Configuration management** (`backend/config.py`):
   - Use `tomli` to read from `config.toml`
   - Use `pydantic-settings` to create Settings class
   - Create default `config.toml` if it doesn't exist
   - Provide a global `settings` object accessible throughout backend
3. **Database setup** (`backend/database.py`):
   - Configure SQLAlchemy async engine with `aiosqlite`
   - Create declarative base class
   - Provide async session factory with FastAPI dependency injection
   - Create `init_db()` async function to create all tables
4. **Database models** (`backend/models.py`):
   - Define all SQLAlchemy ORM models matching schema above
   - Set up relationships (e.g., Transaction.account, Transaction.category)
   - Use appropriate SQLAlchemy types (String, Integer, Boolean, DateTime, Date, Numeric)
5. **Basic FastAPI backend** (`backend/main.py`):
   - Create FastAPI app with CORS middleware (allow localhost origins)
   - Mount static file serving for frontend directory
   - Add startup event handler to call init_db()
   - Create health check endpoint: `GET /api/health` returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
6. **Main entry point** (`app.py`):
   - Use `uvicorn.run()` to start FastAPI app
   - Read host/port from settings
   - Auto-open browser if configured
7. **Frontend shell** (`frontend/index.html`):
   - Load Vue.js 3, Vue Router, Chart.js, Axios from CDN
   - Create `<div id="app"></div>` mount point
   - Import all component JavaScript files as modules
8. **Vue.js app** (`frontend/app.js`):
   - Create root Vue application using `Vue.createApp()`
   - Register Vue Router
   - Include Sidebar component in main layout
9. **Vue Router** (`frontend/router.js`):
   - Define routes for all pages (dashboard, transactions, category-transfers, configuration, all 5 reports)
   - Use HTML5 history mode
   - Export router for use in app.js
10. **Sidebar navigation** (`frontend/components/Sidebar.js`):
    - Vue component with "MoneyWise" title
    - `<router-link>` elements for all main pages
    - Collapsible "Reports" section with all report types
11. **Placeholder pages**: Create Vue components for:
    - Dashboard.js, Transactions.js, CategoryTransfers.js, Configuration.js
    - All report components (AccountReports.js, Balances.js, SpendingReports.js, CategoryReports.js, TrendReports.js)
    - Each should just display page title and "Coming soon..." message
12. **Basic styling** (`frontend/static/styles.css`):
    - Flexbox layout: fixed sidebar + scrollable main content
    - Modern, clean design with readable fonts
    - Blue/gray color scheme
    - Sidebar dark background with white text
    - Main content light background

#### Testing Checklist for User:

   - Reconciliation endpoints: GET /api/reconciliations, POST /api/reconciliations, GET /api/reconciliations/account/{id}, DELETE /api/reconciliations/{id}

4. **Frontend API client** (`frontend/api.js` - add to existing):
   - Add reconciliation functions

5. **Update Transactions UI** (`frontend/components/Transactions.js`):
   - Add reconciliation section showing "Last reconciled on: [date]" or "Not reconciled"
   - Add "Mark as Reconciled" button with date picker
   - Show reconciliation points in transaction list with marker

6. **Update Dashboard** to show last reconciled date under accounts

#### Testing Checklist for User:
- [ ] Navigate to Transactions
- [ ] **Test Reconciliation:**
  - [ ] Check real bank balance
  - [ ] Verify MoneyWise shows same balance
  - [ ] Click "Mark as Reconciled"
  - [ ] Verify date displays
  - [ ] Check Dashboard shows date under account
  - [ ] Reconcile all accounts
- [ ] **Test After More Transactions:**
  - [ ] Add new transactions
  - [ ] Verify last reconciled date doesn't change
  - [ ] Reconcile again with new date

**User must test with real bank statements before proceeding to Phase 6.**

### Phase 6-10: Reports

Build all 5 report types following similar patterns:
- Backend: calculations in crud.py, API endpoint in main.py
- Frontend: API client function, Vue component with filters/charts/tables, styling

**Phase 6 (v0.7.0-alpha): Account Reports**
- Transaction history and charts for individual accounts over time
- Filters: account selector, time period
- Chart: monthly inflow/outflow/balance using Chart.js
- Tables: monthly stats and transaction list

**Phase 7 (v0.7.5-alpha): Balances**
- Settled transactions by account with balances
- Account selector
- Balance display (actual = settled for now)
- Transaction list in reverse chronological order

**Phase 8 (v0.8.0-alpha): Spending Reports**
- Spending by category over date range
- Filters: date range, optional category
- Chart: horizontal bar chart of categories (outflow/inflow)
- Tables: category totals, transaction list when category selected

**Phase 9 (v0.8.5-alpha): Category Reports**
- Deep dive into single category's history
- Filters: category, time period, facet (balance/budgeted/activity)
- Chart: selected facet over time
- Tables: monthly data, transactions for selected month

**Phase 10 (v0.9.0-alpha): Trend Reports**
- Multi-category trends with stacked charts
- Filters: time period, multi-select categories (max 6)
- Chart: stacked bar/area chart showing all selected categories
- Tables: transaction list for selected category and month

Each report phase follows same pattern:
1. Build calculations in backend
2. Create API endpoint
3. Build Vue component with filters, Chart.js visualization, data tables
4. Style consistently
5. User tests with real data before next phase

---

### Phase 11: Account Transfers (v0.9.5-alpha)
**Goal:** Transfer money between accounts with auto-linked transactions.

#### What to Build:

1. **Account transfer logic** (`backend/crud.py` - add to existing):
   - When creating account transfer, create TWO linked transactions:
     - Outflow from source account (negative amount)
     - Inflow to destination account (positive amount)
   - Both get same UUID `transfer_id`
   - Both marked `is_transfer = True`
   - Both get `category_id = None`
   - If one deleted, automatically delete the other

2. **Transfer endpoints** (`backend/main.py` - add to existing):
   - POST /api/transfers/account - create paired transactions
   - DELETE /api/transfers/{transfer_id} - delete both
   - PATCH /api/transfers/{transfer_id} - update both

3. **Frontend API client** (`frontend/api.js` - add to existing):
   - Add account transfer functions

4. **Update Transactions UI** (`frontend/components/Transactions.js`):
   - Add "Account Transfer" button/option
   - Show different form: Date, Amount (positive), From Account, To Account, Memo
   - In table, show ↕️ indicator for transfers
   - Delete warns about deleting both sides

5. **Validation**: Cannot transfer to same account, amount must be positive

#### Testing Checklist for User:
- [ ] **Test Create Transfer:**
  - [ ] Transfer $500 from Checking to Savings
  - [ ] Verify TWO transactions created (one negative, one positive)
  - [ ] Verify both have ↕️ indicator
- [ ] **Test Balances:**
  - [ ] Verify Checking decreased by $500
  - [ ] Verify Savings increased by $500
  - [ ] Total unchanged
- [ ] **Test Edit/Delete:**
  - [ ] Edit one side - verify both update
  - [ ] Delete - verify both deleted
- [ ] **Test with Real Transfers:**
  - [ ] Record real transfer between accounts

**User must verify before proceeding to Phase 12.**

### Phase 12: Backup & Export (v1.0.0-beta)
**Goal:** Automatic database backups and manual export.

#### What to Build:

1. **Backup functionality** (`backend/backup.py` - new file):
   - Create backup service class
   - Function to create timestamped backup
   - Function to list backups
   - Function to restore from backup
   - Auto-backup on startup if configured
   - Keep last N backups (configurable)
   - Use `aiofiles` for async operations

2. **Export functionality** (`backend/export.py` - new file):
   - Export transactions to CSV
   - Export category transfers to CSV
   - Export all data to JSON
   - Support filtered exports

3. **API endpoints** (`backend/main.py` - add to existing):
   - POST /api/backup/create, GET /api/backup/list, POST /api/backup/restore/{id}
   - GET /api/export/transactions, GET /api/export/all (with filters)
   - Set file download headers

4. **Frontend API client** (`frontend/api.js` - add to existing):
   - Add backup/export functions
   - Handle file downloads

5. **Add Backup/Export to Configuration page**:
   - Backups section: Create button, list of backups with Restore/Delete buttons
   - Export section: Export buttons, date range filters

6. **Update app.py** to backup on startup if configured

#### Testing Checklist for User:
- [ ] **Test Manual Backup:**
  - [ ] Click "Create Backup Now"
  - [ ] Verify backup in list with timestamp
  - [ ] Verify file in backups/ directory
- [ ] **Test Auto Backup:**
  - [ ] Enable in config
  - [ ] Restart app
  - [ ] Verify backup created
- [ ] **Test Export CSV:**
  - [ ] Export transactions
  - [ ] Open in Excel
  - [ ] Verify all data present and correct
- [ ] **Test Export JSON:**
  - [ ] Export all data
  - [ ] Verify valid JSON format
- [ ] **Test Restore (CAREFUL!):**
  - [ ] Add test transaction
  - [ ] Restore old backup
  - [ ] Verify data reverted (test transaction gone)
- [ ] **Test Backup Rotation:**
  - [ ] Create 15+ backups
  - [ ] Verify only last 10 kept

**User must test backup/restore before v1.0.0.**
